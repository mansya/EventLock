# EventLock

An Xposed module to show your calendar events on the lockscreen.

### Why?

* After Kitkat, the lockscreen widgets were disabled and so calendar widget can't be put on the lockscreen.
* AOSP lockscreen for lolipop/marshmallow does not show calendar events on lockscreen either.

### Features

* See multiple events by scrolling
* Lots of customisations
